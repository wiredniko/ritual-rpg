# Design Philosophy
**Open**: Designed to be modular and extensible to make it your own. Avoids tight coupling of mechanics. Use the parts you like, steal or make your own for the rest.
**Accessible**: Simple and fast character generation with consistent rules that can be learned during play.
**Fiction Focused**: It’s about exploring the world, not endless stats. All the rules aim to enhance the fiction.
**Guidelines**: Provide descriptive instead of prescriptive dogma. They are there to help to make better rulings instead of overcomplicated rules.
**Growth**: The hero's journey. Interacting with the world, allows characters to learn new skills and grow based on what happens in the game.
**Death**: Characters are mortals. A dagger to the heart can kill.

# Introduction
The role-playing game Ritual, is about getting a group of people together and through creativity, wits, shenanigans, collaboration and luck you, the players and Summoner can create something from nothing. Collectively, you can perform a ritual that transports a group of people to another world.

Ritual is a game for people ages 10 and up. At a minimum, it requires a Summoner to create the world, and at least one player to play in it. A set of polyhedral dice (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided dice set), paper and pencils is recommended. 

The game can be more enjoyable when played with 4 - 8 players, and pizza is included.
